Not only is Pokémon a lot of fun, it's incredibly mathematically rich as well. Whether you're catching, battling, or breeding, these games are full of cool math applications that can be educational and (dare I say it!) fun to explore as well. This blog is a way to showcase some of these applications, from the basics of probability to sophisticated artificial intelligence techniques.
