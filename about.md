## Contributing

This is a a collaborative blog, and guest contribtions are happily welcomed! GitHub pull requests are the preferred format, although Git + Jekyll + Kramdown can be a steep learning curve for the uninitiated, so contributions in other formats via issues can usually be accomodated as well.
